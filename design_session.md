# Design Session - Speaking AI App Development

## Initial Market Research & Validation

### TikTok Research Discovery
- Found viral teleprompter content: "Could you give a speech at the Grammys?" (6M views, 1940 comments, 411k likes)
- Text scrolling format: "Wow. Standing here right now... I'm just trying to take it all in. This stage. The Grammys..."
- Users actively practice along with teleprompter until specific triggers (like "Beyonc√©" mention)
- Another viral video: "Could you sing on stage?" (21M views) - proves teleprompter challenge category is massive

### Blake Anderson Framework Application
- **Core positioning**: "AI that rates how good you are at public speaking"
- **Familiar mental model**: FIFA-style 1-100 scoring system (not 1-10 like initially thought)
- **Viral hook**: "Find out if you'd bomb on stage in 30 seconds"
- **Social comparison**: "You speak better than 68% of people"

### Competitive Analysis Results
**Existing players identified:**
- **Amplivio**: $12.99/month, targeting emerging markets, 100+ practice prompts
- **Yoodli**: 100K+ professionals, real-time feedback during calls
- **Orai**: Comprehensive speech analysis (tempo, clarity, pitch, filler words)
- **VocalImage**: 3M+ users, voice type discovery
- **Poised**: Real-time feedback on Zoom calls

**Market gap identified**: Most apps are training-focused vs. instant rating/scoring

### Strategic Positioning
**Our advantage**: "Rate your speaking skills" vs. "Train your speaking skills"
- More direct and instant gratification
- Lower barrier to entry (curiosity vs. commitment to improvement)
- More shareable ("I got 73/100" vs. "I completed lesson 5")
- Targets US/Europe premium market vs. emerging market competitors

## Blake Anderson Design Principles Applied

### Core Psychology Framework
- **Familiar Mental Model**: FIFA-style 1-100 scoring system everyone understands
- **"Did You Hear About" Test**: "Did you hear about the AI that rates your speaking?"
- **Social Media Integration**: Designed for viral TikTok content
- **Single Core Action**: Rate your speech (like Tinder's swipe, TikTok's scroll)

### Three Core Design Principles
1. **Minimize Cognitive Load**: "Every tap, decision, and moment of confusion hinders your app's growth"
   - Target: 1 button (like Umax's "scan your face")
   - 5-Year-Old Test: Must be simple enough for a child to use
   - 80/20 Rule: Launch with the 20% of features that provide 80% of value

2. **Do Not Reinvent the Wheel**: "Save your innovation for solving the core problem"
   - FIFA Rating System: Users already understand 1-100 player ratings
   - Standard UI Patterns: Settings in top-right, familiar navigation
   - Leverage Existing Mental Models: Don't create new interaction patterns

3. **Think Like Your Customer**: "Apps that go viral are designed by people who understand users obsessively"
   - Become the customer: Use r/PublicSpeaking, practice speeches yourself
   - Deep user research: What specific problems do they have?
   - Build for real needs: Not imaginary feature requests

### Blake Anderson's 3 Methods Applied
1. **Method 1: Figma-First Design**
   - Learn Figma: All successful apps start in Figma
   - UX over UI: Focus on what components do, not corner radius
   - Quick iteration: Turn ideas into tangible designs fast

2. **Method 2: Create Idea Board (Screenshots)**
   - Mobbin.com: Study existing app patterns
   - FIFA/Madden: Rating system inspiration
   - AI Avatar Apps: Upload image flow patterns
   - Great designers screenshot: Don't reinvent successful patterns

3. **Method 3: Study Viral Content First**
   - Work backwards: Study viral TikTok content, then design screens to fit
   - Content integration: Design specifically for social media sharing
   - Tens of hours: Deep research into viral speech/rating content

## App Flow Design

### Screen 1: Onboarding Hook (Blake Anderson Style)
```
"Most people think they're good speakers...
They're wrong üò¨

Find out your REAL speaking score"

[Rate My Speaking] ‚Üê 1 BUTTON ONLY
```

**Blake Anderson Requirements:**
- 1 button maximum (following Umax's "scan your face" model)
- "Did you hear about" test: Copy must be remarkable enough to tell friends
- No explanations: If it needs explaining, it's too complex
- TikTok 3-second rule: Must capture attention instantly

### Screen 2: Challenge Selection

[Scrolling text at speaking pace]

üî¥ Stop Recording
```

### Screen 4: Results Screen (The Viral Moment)
```
üéØ Your Speaking Rating: 73/100

"Professional Level Speaker"

## Blake Anderson Hard Paywall Strategy

### Key Discovery: Hard Paywall vs Soft Paywall
Analysis of RIZZ vs Plug AI apps reveals critical monetization insight:

**RIZZ (Original - Blake Anderson):**
- Monthly Downloads: 75K
- Monthly Revenue: 150K  
- Paywall: Free Trial - **Soft Paywall**
- Revenue per download: $2.00

**Plug AI (Copy with Hard Paywall):**
- Monthly Downloads: 35K (less downloads)
- Monthly Revenue: 250K (**67% more revenue!**)
- Paywall: Free Trial - **Hard Paywall**
- Revenue per download: $7.14 (**3.5x more profitable!**)

### Hard Paywall Psychology
1. **Curiosity Peak**: Free onboarding ‚Üí Free action ‚Üí **PAYWALL before results**
2. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: User invested time, wants to see outcome
3. **Premium Positioning**: Immediate payment = premium perception
4. **Higher Intent Users**: Only serious buyers convert

### Hard Paywall Implementation for Speaking App
```
Free Tier:
- Onboarding hook
- Record 30-second speech  
- "Analyzing your speaking..." loading screen

Hard Paywall ($4.99):
- "Your Speaking Score is Ready!"
- No preview, no trial
- Must pay to see any results

Premium Results:
- FIFA-style 1-100 score
- Detailed breakdown with waveform visualization
- Viral share cards
- Improvement suggestions
```

### The Copycat Success Pattern
Plug AI proved you can:
1. Copy successful viral app concept
2. Apply harder paywall strategy
3. Out-earn original with fewer users  
4. Launch later and still win with superior monetization

### Strategic Opportunity
Since Blake Anderson hasn't targeted speaking/public speaking vertical:
- Use his proven viral mechanics
- Apply Plug AI's hard paywall strategy
- Target untapped niche
- Potentially achieve $250K+ monthly revenue with fewer downloads

## Next Steps
1. Buy screendesign.com domain
2. Complete Figma design (2-3 days) with hard paywall flow
3. Build MVP with OpenAI transcription + hard paywall
4. Test conversion rates vs soft paywall approach
5. Launch viral TikTok content strategy targeting paywall moments
