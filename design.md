```

**Blake Anderson Requirements:**

## Design Don'ts (Common Mistakes to Avoid)

‚ùå **Hidden social proof**: Always show popularity/usage stats
‚ùå **Slow gratification**: Score must appear immediately
‚ùå **Unclear next action**: Always have obvious next step
‚ùå **Text-heavy interfaces**: Visual hierarchy over explanations
