# Pricing Strategy

## Target Audience: General Consumers

For general consumers, credit-based pricing is the optimal approach over token-based pricing.

## Why Credits Work Better for General Consumers

**Simplicity**: Regular users don't understand tokens/API costs - they just want to know "how many conversations can I have?"

**Predictability**: Credits feel like phone minutes or game coins - familiar and finite.

**No Sticker Shock**: Token pricing can vary wildly per conversation, creating unpredictable bills.

## Credit-Based Pricing Strategy

### Positioning
Frame credits as "AI conversations" or "chat sessions" rather than technical units.

### Pricing Tiers
- **Free**: 30 credits (trial experience)
- **Pro**: 300 credits/month 
- **Ultra**: 1000 credits/month

### Credit Consumption
Make it intuitive:
- Simple chat = 1 credit
- Complex/long conversation = 2-3 credits
- Image analysis = 2 credits

### Communication Strategy
Use language like:
- "Get 300 AI conversations per month"
- "Each credit = one meaningful conversation"
- Avoid mentioning tokens entirely

## Buffer Strategy

### What is Buffer Strategy?
Buffer strategy means pricing your credits higher than your actual costs to create a financial cushion.

### Example:
- Your actual cost: $0.10 per conversation (in tokens)
- Your credit price: $0.13 per conversation 
- **Buffer = 30%** ($0.03 extra per credit)

### Why You Need a Buffer:

**1. Cost Protection**
- AI model prices can increase suddenly
- Usage patterns vary (some users consume more tokens per credit)
- High-complexity conversations cost more tokens

**2. Business Sustainability**
- Covers operational costs (servers, support, development)
- Provides profit margin for growth
- Handles unexpected usage spikes

**3. Price Stability**
- You don't need to raise prices immediately when AI costs increase
- Buffer absorbs small cost fluctuations

### Real Example:
If OpenAI costs you $1000/month for tokens:
- **No buffer**: Charge exactly $1000 → any cost increase = immediate loss
- **30% buffer**: Charge $1300 → you have $300 cushion for cost increases

### Recommended Buffer Sizes:
- **Conservative**: 20-25% buffer
- **Standard**: 30-40% buffer  
- **High-uncertainty markets**: 50%+ buffer

## Hybrid Recommendation

Consider **credit-based with token conversion behind the scenes**:
- Sell credits in packages (30/300/1000)
- Convert tokens to credits internally (e.g., 1000 tokens = 1 credit)
- Adjust conversion rates as model costs change
- Show both credits used and token count in usage history

This gives you pricing flexibility while maintaining user simplicity and protects your business while keeping prices predictable for users.
