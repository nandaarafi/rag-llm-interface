# Founder Agent: Viral B2C App Development Guide
*Based on Blake Anderson's methodology - First person to build 3 apps with millions in downloads and profit in one year*

## Blake Anderson's Viral Apps
- **Rizz GPT** → AI that helps you text girls
- **Umax** → AI that rates how attractive you are  
- **Cal AI** → AI that counts calories from photos

## Core Philosophy
A **viral idea** minimizes friction from inception to millions of users. Focus on **single-player utility apps** that don't require complex backend or social functionality. The idea sets the foundation for design, development, and distribution.

# Three Core Principles for Viral Ideas

## Principle 1: Solve Big Problems
Think Maslow's hierarchy of needs - solve the most fundamental problems:
- **Rizz GPT**: helps you get more girls
- **Umax**: helps you become more attractive  
- **Cal AI**: helps you achieve fitness goals

Your app doesn't have to be the complete solution, but frame it as **one solution to a big problem** rather than the full solution to a minor problem.

**The biological imperative**: Life exists to continue living and reproduce. Help people with those things.

## Principle 2: More Complicated Means Less Viral
**Virality is contingent on simplicity.**

You should describe your app's unique nature in **three words**:
- **Rizz GPT**: respond to girls
- **Umax**: face analysis  
- **Cal AI**: photo calorie counter

Simplicity affects every part of growth:
- How easily people understand your app
- How likely they are to tell friends
- How quickly it can be demonstrated in content

**TikTok test**: You have maximum 3 seconds to capture attention. If your app's too complicated for that, you're fighting uphill.

## Principle 3: "Did You Hear About" Test
Your app needs to be **remarkable** - something people naturally want to tell friends about.

**Fill in this sentence naturally:**
- "Did you hear about the AI that can text girls for you?"
- "Did you hear about the app that rates how attractive you are?"  
- "Did you hear about the app that lets you count calories just with pictures?"

**Test questions:**
- Would somebody bring it up at a party?
- Would somebody text their mom about it?
- Would somebody send it in their group chat?

Your app needs to make people feel something: **surprise, excitement, anger - anything but indifference.**

# Three Methods to Find Viral Ideas

## Method 1: Scan Social Media

**This is non-negotiable.** Social media is a manifestation of the collective conscious - what are people interested in and talking about?

### Research Tactics
- **Use Google Trends** to see what's popping off
- **Explore Reddit communities** and read comment sections
- **Analyze Instagram/TikTok** comment sections
- **Create new social media accounts** to consume content you'd never engage with

### Breaking Out of Your Bubble
**Example**: If you're a 25-year-old guy who watches weightlifting/programming content:
- Create new account engaging with 35-year-old mom content
- Cooking for family, interior design, pickleball
- You'll discover parts of the internet you never knew existed

### Case Study: Umax Discovery
- Blake saw one post about "looksmaxxing" that piqued interest
- Created dedicated accounts consuming looksmaxxing content
- Found what forums they lived on, what products they used
- Discovered exactly what problems these people had
- Built Umax around those specific problems

**Key Insight**: Your feed is naturally an echo chamber. **New Perspectives = New Opportunities = New Viral Ideas**

## Method 2: Research App Store and Play Store

### Research Process
- Download a new app everyday
- Watch their social media content
- Figure out why they're succeeding or failing
- Before building CalAI, research ALL calorie trackers on app store
- Identify shortcomings and room for improvement

### Key Insights
- If an app idea has been tried 100 times and doesn't work, it's a bad idea
- Identify market gaps and inefficiencies
- If you can identify a problem across the industry that nobody has solved, you might be onto something

## Method 3: Disconnect

### The Power of Mental Space
- Best ideas won't come if you're forcing them
- Moments of clarity happen during: long walks (no phone, no music), hiking, showers, workouts
- You need space from all the daily information input
- Going on social media and doing app research are inputs
- Your mind needs time and space to process that into output

### The Problem with Constant Consumption
- Most founders consume content 24/7 (scrolling X.com, reading tech articles, watching TikToks)
- No space for original thought = everyone builds the same thing
- Everyone saw ChatGPT → made AI chatbots
- Everyone saw Stable Diffusion → made AI avatar generators

### Real Viral Opportunities Through Synthesis
- **Male Dating Frustration + AI = Rizz GPT**
- **Looksmaxxing Problems + AI Vision = Umax**  
- **Calorie Counting + AI Computer Vision = Cal AI**

These ideas happen when your mind has clarity and space to connect dots.

**The greatest founders aren't necessarily the smartest - they're the ones that dare to think differently.**

# Method 2: How to Design a Viral App

## Design Objective
**Viral app design seeks to minimize friction from design to millions of users.** Focus on single-player utility apps that solve problems straightforwardly without complex social interaction.

**Key insight**: The majority of Umax's success came from the design of **one single screen**.

---

# Three Core Design Principles

## Principle 1: Minimize Cognitive Load
**Every tap, decision, and moment of confusion hinders your app's growth.**

### Button Count Examples
- **Rizz GPT**: 2 buttons (upload screenshot, get pickup lines)
- **Umax**: 1 button (scan your face)  
- **Cal AI**: 1 button (analyze your food)

### The 5-Year-Old Test
If it's too complicated for a 5-year-old to use, you're headed in the wrong direction.

### The Pareto Principle for Apps
- **80% of functionality comes from 20% of possible features**
- **Launch with the 20%**
- Most viral apps launch with **one core action** users really like:
  - **Tinder**: swipe right to match
  - **TikTok**: swipe up for new video

## Principle 2: Do Not Reinvent the Wheel
**The hardest part of app design is figuring out initial layout** - but successful apps have already figured this out for you.

### Leverage Existing Patterns
- Users have learned dozens of apps and built muscle memory
- Settings button belongs in top right (everyone decided this for you)
- Fighting against expectations creates friction

### Case Study: Umax Rating System
- Drew inspiration from **FIFA and Madden football player ratings**
- Users already familiar with this rating concept
- **If your app is differentiated in functionality, you don't need to differentiate in design**

**Save your innovation for solving the core problem. For everything else, follow standard practice.**

## Principle 3: Think Like Your Customer
**The biggest mistake founders make is designing for imaginary users.**

### Case Studies
**Cal AI**: Blake had used MyFitnessPal and other calorie trackers - he knew what functionality people wanted.

**Umax**: Blake had no idea what "looksmaxxing" was, so he:
- Joined Discord servers
- Watched the content  
- Read the forums
- Discovered it was mostly about skincare, haircare, and being healthy

### The Transformation
**This isn't just market research - this is becoming your customer:**
- You start seeing your app through their eyes
- You stop thinking about "cool features"  
- You start thinking about features that actually solve problems

**Apps that go viral aren't designed in a vacuum - they're designed by people who understand users on a deep, almost obsessive level.**

**Either build for who you are today, or become the person you're building for.**

# Three Core Design Methods

## Method 1: Learn Figma
**Stop looking at other design tools, AI design, or Canva. Learn Figma.**

Every successful app Blake has seen began in Figma. Designing is the most important act in transferring ideas into something tangible.

### UX vs UI Priority
Blake prioritizes **User Experience (UX) over User Interface (UI)**:
- Not overly focused on corner radius or gradient overlays
- More concerned with **what key components do and how they help the user**

### Learning Path
1. **Watch 1-hour basic Figma tutorial** on YouTube
2. **Try redesigning an actual app's interface** in Figma

**Goal**: Not to become professional designer, but to turn ideas into something tangible as quickly as possible.

## Method 2: Create an Idea Board
**This can just be a collection of screenshots** from apps with similar functionality.

### Examples
- **Umax**: Madden and FIFA rating systems + upload image flow from AI avatar generators
- **Cal AI**: Homepage of every other calorie tracker

### Process
- Look for patterns: what works, what doesn't, what you like/dislike
- Be systematic: draw inspiration from onboarding, settings, homepages, different flows
- **This becomes your reference library** for when you get stuck

### Recommended Tool
**Mobbin.com** - copy and paste screenshots instead of downloading apps

**Classic saying**: "Great artists steal." **Here**: "Great designers screenshot."

## Method 3: Study the Content
**The majority of Umax's success was attributable to design of one screen** - the Madden/FIFA style rating screen.

### The Process
1. **Study content that went viral on social media**
2. **Work backwards from there**
3. **Design screens that seamlessly integrate into already existing content**

### Case Studies
- **Rizz GPT**: Found style of Rizz slideshows that went most viral, then designed screens to integrate seamlessly
- **Umax**: Studied viral transformation content, designed rating screen to fit that format

### The Time Investment
**Spend tens or hundreds of hours studying content** to understand:
- What sort of designs will do best
- What people want to see  
- How it integrates into social media content

**You should have social media accounts dedicated to consuming content only in your app's niche** - this content will inform how to design your product and the most viral screens in it.

# Method 3: How to Develop Your App

## Development Objective
**Viral development seeks to minimize friction from your first line of code to millions of users.** Focus on single-player utility apps without social functionality or overly complex backends.

**Key insight**: Development is arguably the hardest and most time-intensive part of the process. This is where most people give up and where you're most likely to fail.

---

# Three Core Development Principles

## Principle 1: Growth Mindset
**Reality check on AI development claims:**
- ❌ **"Build functional app in 1 hour with AI"** = Complete lie
- ❌ **"Can't go from zero to functional app in 1 month with AI"** = Also a lie
- ✅ **Truth is somewhere in between**

### The Biggest Barrier for Beginners
**It's not lack of technical skill - it's mindset.**

Blake built Rizz GPT with barely any coding experience using **AI as personal tutor and assistant**.

### Key Mindset Shifts
- **Don't view AI as doing all the work** - view it as effective tool and tutor
- **Don't get fed up and quit** if you can't build in 1 hour like gurus claim
- **Push yourself to your limit** and move as quickly as possible
- **Don't settle** for notion it will take a year to build something
- **Get started today** even if you're not completely ready
- **Your first version will be bad** - that's okay, Rizz GPT's first version was terrible but it worked

## Principle 2: Deep Work and Time Blocking
**Development requires focused, uninterrupted time.**

### The Mental Challenge
If you've never built anything technical/scientific/quantitative, you'll have to push your mind to deeper limits than it's used to.

**Social media users often struggle** making transition from fast-moving world to going extremely deep and isolating from everything else.

### Implementation Strategy
- **Block 4 hours of deep work** for coding
- **Remove all distractions**: no phone, no email, no distractions
- **Just you, code editor, AI, and Stack Overflow**
- **Set specific goals** for each session:
  - Build camera interface
  - Finish onboarding
  - Add paywall
- **Don't code aimlessly** - create plan and execute

### Critical Truth
**Apps that fail aren't the ones with bad code** - biggest failure is not shipping anything at all because you didn't set aside time to get it done.

**This isn't about working more hours - it's about making your hours count.**

## Principle 3: Progressive Overload
**Just like weightlifting - gradually increase difficulty** for both product and coding skills.

### For Your Product - Start with Absolute Minimum
- **Rizz GPT**: upload screenshot → get response
- **Umax**: upload face → get ratings  
- **Cal AI**: upload food image → get calories

### For Your Development Skills
- **Start with easy applications**
- If Blake tried to build Umax or Cal AI first, would have been much more difficult
- They're simple apps but would have taken twice as long as Rizz GPT
- May have never gotten to finish line at all

### The Learning Curve
- **Early days**: 10 hours debugging something that should take 1 hour
- **Next time**: 5 hours
- **Then**: 3 hours, then 2 hours
- **Eventually**: 1 hour it's supposed to take

**Build → Ship → Learn**

# Three Core Development Methods

## Method 1: Use React Native with Expo in Cursor
**Blake's recommended front-end development stack for 2025.**

### The Stack
- **React Native**: Primary development framework
- **Expo**: Simplifies workflow  
- **Cursor**: Best AI code editor

### Why This Stack
- **Build for iOS and Android simultaneously**
- **Ship updates extremely quickly**
- **Use AI to accelerate development**
- **Learn front-end and ship products as fast as possible**

### Blake's Experience
Started with Swift UI, but would use this recommended stack if restarting today.

**For beginners**: This is by far the best stack to learn in 2025
**For experienced developers**: If you have different stack you use, that's fine - don't overcomplicate it

**Philosophy**: "Generally err on side of do first, learn second"

## Method 2: Set Up Backend Infrastructure
**Blake admits this is highly contentious topic and he's not an expert, but speaks from experience.**

### Database & Authentication
**Use Supabase or Firebase** - these services handle:
- User authentication
- Database management
- File storage  
- API endpoint setup

### Monetization
**Use SuperWall** for paywall testing - enables you to:
- A/B test paywalls
- Test different offerings at different points in app
- Try different designs in real time

### AI Functionality
**Recommended AI APIs:**
- **Anthropic** (builders of Claude)
- **OpenAI** (builders of ChatGPT)

**Process:**
- Search up their API endpoints on Google
- Read their documentation to understand how API endpoints work
- Stay up to date with newest AI technologies to improve functionality or create new features

### Philosophy
**Prioritize letting big established platforms do the heavy lifting** rather than custom setup.

## Method 3: Learn How to Prompt AI (Most Important Method)
**Beyond app development - this is probably the most important skill of the future.**

### Key Principle 1: Be Specific and Structured
- **Break down complex tasks into smaller ones**
- **Give AI examples** of what you're looking for - if you don't, it has to guess
- **Be very specific** about what you want to get out (similar to working with humans)

### Key Principle 2: Iterate and Refine
- **Test different ways** of speaking to AI
- **Try different ways** of explaining what you're looking for  
- **Short feedback loop** = quick data on what works and what doesn't
- **Over time figure out** prompting techniques that work best

### Key Principle 3: Save Your Prompts
**Build an arsenal of prompts** for different use cases:
- AI code generation (specific format prompts)
- Content script generation  
- Development, content creation, marketing, design ideation

### Example: Bad vs Good Prompting

**❌ Bad Prompt:**
"Hey can you build an app where I can upload a screenshot and then it gives me responses for girls"

**✅ Good Prompt:**
"Hey can you give me one button in the center that says 'upload screenshot' and has white text within it and red text around it and then when I press that you pull up the photo library module at which point I can upload an image which will then call the OpenAI API"

### The Process
1. **Be extremely specific** about structure you're looking for
2. **Set up initial structures**
3. **Iterate back and forth** over time
4. **Figure out actual structure** you're looking for
5. **Save prompting techniques** that work best

### Remember: AI is Co-Pilot, Not Autopilot
- **Better prompts + clearer direction = more value**
- **Takes time to learn and improve** like all skills
- **Probably the best investment you can make in yourself**

# Method 4: How to Market a Viral App

## Marketing Objective
**Viral marketing seeks to minimize friction from your launch to millions of users.** Focus on single-player utility apps that solve problems without complex backends.

**Key insight**: Marketing is where most apps fall flat. You can build an amazing product, but if you don't know how to attract target users, nobody will get to use it.

---

# Three Core Marketing Principles

## Principle 1: Stop Studying, Start Doing
**This principle applies to far more than just marketing.**

### The Analysis Paralysis Problem
- Too many founders stuck in **endless research and studying**
- Devising "perfect launch strategy" instead of **actually doing the thing**
- **No amount of research can replace real-world experience**

### What to Do Instead
- **Create content**
- **Talk to influencers** 
- **Set up Meta and TikTok ad campaigns**
- **Try → Fail → Succeed → Analyze** what worked and what didn't

### Blake's Experience
- **Best marketers didn't learn from courses**
- **Blake has never purchased a marketing course in his entire life**
- **80% of time should be spent doing, 20% studying and reflecting**
- When you do study, **focus on actual case studies rather than theory**

### Common Excuses (and Responses)
- **"I need to learn more first"** → You'll learn by doing
- **"I don't want to waste money"** → You can create free content yourself  
- **"I don't know any creators"** → Start DMing them

### Reality Check
**Your first attempts will almost certainly fail** - Blake's did too. That's okay. That doesn't mean you need to study more, it means you need to **keep failing and getting shots up** until you figure out how to make it work.

## Principle 2: Understand Human Psychology
**In its most primitive form, marketing is understanding how people think and what motivates them** and figuring out how to leverage that to capture attention.

### Core Human Desires Most Successful Apps Tap Into
- **Sexual attraction**
- **Social status**  
- **Self-improvement**
- **Entertainment**

### Case Studies
- **Rizz GPT**: Went viral because it tapped into people's desire to be **charismatic with opposite sex**
- **Umax**: Went viral because it **validates how attractive people think they are**
- **Cal AI**: Went viral because it helps people **achieve fitness goals**

### The Key Shift
**Focus on emotional benefit and problem it solves for user, not just features.**

**Don't tell me what your app does - tell me how it will make my life better.**

## Principle 3: Rapid Iteration
**The real key for success is rapidly iterating and optimizing for learning** until you figure out scalable strategies.

### Case Study: Umax Content Hooks
Blake came up with list of hooks and tested them:

**Hook 1: POV Transformation**
- "POV you use the Umax app to glow up"
- Creator shows side-by-side face ratings before/after
- Goes from 5.5 rating to 9.5 rating

**Hook 2: Personalized Recommendations**  
- "Here are the best haircuts for your face shape"
- Creators scan face and show recommended haircut in Umax app

### The Process
- **Tested 5-10 different hooks** across own accounts + influencers
- **Figured out which ones perform best**
- **Doubled down on those**
- **Enabled scaling to $600k+ monthly revenue within 3 months**

### The Famous Pottery Class Story
**Professor's experiment**: 
- **Class 1**: Entire semester to make single best pot
- **Class 2**: Graded purely on number of pots produced

**Result**: Class 2 didn't just make more pots - **they made better pots too**. They learned through trial and error, rapidly iterating.

**Lesson**: When marketing new product, **you have unlimited pots. Make more, learn faster.**

### Key Mindset
- **Don't get emotionally attached to any single marketing angle**
- **Allow the data to guide you**
- Even Blake (who's "pretty good at marketing") can't come up with hooks that work every time

# Three Core Marketing Methods

## Method 1: Internal UGC (User Generated Content)
**Most profitable way to market your app** (though least scalable). **Best place to start with little to no capital.**

### What is Internal UGC
**Content created and posted to company-owned accounts.**

### Case Study: Rizz GPT
- **Tens of accounts** named "GetRizzGPT" or "RizzGPTApp" etc.
- Started with main account (now named Plug AI) run by co-founders Alex and Evan
- **Started with video demos** of the app
- **Quickly shifted to Rizz slideshow content**
- **Within first month**: Generated nearly **50 million views** on main account alone

### The Scaling Process
- As they figured out winning strategies, **hired teams of UGC creators** to run accounts
- **4 of 5 accounts flopped, but 1 produced 20x return**

### How to Get Started with UGC
1. **Study viral hooks and content** in your app's niche
2. **Begin creating content yourself** and figure out what works
3. **Use what you learned to hire UGC creators** to make their own accounts
4. **Scale the process** - retain creators that do well, replace ones that don't

## Method 2: Influencer Partnerships
**Next most profitable way to scale app marketing** and very scalable, but **very difficult to do right.**

**If you want to get good at influencer partnerships, study psychology and statistics.**

### Finding the Right Influencers
- **You should have strong understanding** of content and influencers in your app's niche (from previous methods)
- **"I DMed 10 influencers and nobody responded"** → You need to **DM hundreds**
- **Once you work with them**, ask them to **refer you to other creators** they know

### Pricing Strategy
**Pay influencers based on average view count:**
- If their posts get 100k views on average → pay **$100-$1,000** (depending on niche)
- **Usually cheaper to get them on contract** (4 posts per month) rather than one-off videos

### Quality Assessment
**You need to analyze their comment section:**
- ✅ **Good signs**: Audience is engaged and largely American
- ❌ **Bad signs**: Full of random bot accounts commenting fire emoji

### Attribution Challenge
**Direct attribution is currently next to impossible** for organic social media advertising.

**Solution**: 
- **Closely monitor app's conversion dashboard** in real time
- **Monitor influencer's post** in real time  
- **Assess how well views convert** to downloads and purchases
- **Develop intuitive understanding** of niche and different creators

## Method 3: Platform Ads
**Most scalable method** of app marketing but **least profitable** as percentage of revenue and **requires most upfront capital.**

**For this reason, Blake does NOT recommend prioritizing this strategy if you're a new app developer.**

### Platform Options
- **Meta** (Facebook/Instagram)
- **TikTok**
- **Google**  
- **Apple Search**

### The Process
1. **Compile mass number of creatives** (mix of videos and images, different content styles for every marketing angle)
2. **Install necessary SDKs** for attribution
3. **Run campaigns** starting with small budgets to figure out winning creatives and ad strategies
4. **Scale up** from there

### When Platform Ads Work Best
- **Apps with high LTV** (Customer Lifetime Value) - apps that make lot of money per user
- **Apps with low LTV** generally work better through **organic marketing**

**This is why Blake recommends UGC and influencer partnerships for people getting started.**

## Viral App Formula
**Problem + AI + Simple Design + Viral Hook = Success**

The key is finding problems people are already struggling with, making the solution incredibly simple with AI, and designing it to be instantly shareable on social media.
