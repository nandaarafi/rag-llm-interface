High Priority:
  1. Document Library - You already have basic document handling (app/library/page.tsx,        
  components/document.tsx) but need to enhance it
  2. FastAPI + Qdrant Integration - Requires backend integration for vector search
  3. Google SignIn Fix - Authentication issue that needs debugging

  Medium Priority:
  4. Document Mentions UI - Chat interface enhancements
  5. Landing Pages - Marketing/conversion pages

  Low Priority:
  6. Logo & Icons - Design assets

  Recommended Implementation Order:

  1. Start with Google SignIn fix - foundational auth issue
  2. Enhance document library - build on existing components
  3. Add FastAPI/Qdrant integration - backend connectivity
  4. Implement document mentions - UI improvements
  5. Create landing pages - marketing features
  6. Design assets - polish
