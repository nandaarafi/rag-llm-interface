# Advanced Features and Tips

Ready to take your AI chatbot experience to the next level? Here are some advanced features and pro tips.

## Advanced Conversation Techniques

Try: "Fix this JavaScript function that's supposed to validate email addresses but isn't working properly"
```

### Multi-turn Conversations

Break complex tasks into smaller steps:

1. Start with a general question
2. Provide specific details
3. Ask for clarification or modifications
