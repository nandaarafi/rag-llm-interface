- **Current Policy**: ✅ Eligible (under 10% threshold)
- **Action**: Refund remaining credit value: ($9 × 92.5% = $8.33)

```

### 2. Usage-Based Refund Calculator
```

Minimum Refund = $1 (to cover processing costs)
```

### 3. Subscription-Specific Rules
- **Monthly**: 7-day full refund window, then pro-rated
- **Annual**: 30-day full refund window, then pro-rated quarterly

### 4. Automated Refund Triggers
- **Immediate**: Duplicate purchases (same user, same plan, <1 hour apart)
- **Fast-track**: Zero usage within 48 hours
- **Technical**: Service downtime >24 hours during usage period

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Refund Request Triage
1. **Auto-approve**: Duplicates, zero usage <24hrs
2. **Standard review**: Manual review for policy compliance
3. **Special cases**: Technical issues, disputed charges

### Step 2: Refund Processing
1. **Payment processor**: LemonSqueezy refund API
2. **Credit adjustment**: Deduct used credits from account

4. **Communication**: Automated email confirmation

### Step 3: Anti-Abuse Measures
- **Limit**: 2 refunds per user per 12 months
